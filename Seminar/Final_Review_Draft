This paper speaks about various attacks used to exploit buffer overflows vulnerability, and their behaviour in different mechanisms such as Denial of Service Attacks and Inject attack code. It also speaks about goals of buffer overflow attack to exploit vulnerability. Such as Jump to Random Memory Location, To Place Malicious Code in Victim’s Program Address Space. It also speaks about challenges in buffer overflow attack.

In Companion Proceedings for the ISSTA/ECOOP 2018 Workshops (ISSTA ’18). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 8–9. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3236454.3236455

This paper speaks about feature extraction buffer overflow attacks using supervised learning, and calssification and validation of injection codes through support vector machines (svm) and gradient boost tree (XGBoost). It tells about general usability through learning based methods. Its aim is to identify machine learning techniques that can be used to replace hand-crafted static analysis tools.
